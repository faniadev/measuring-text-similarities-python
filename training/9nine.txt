INTRODUCTION



In writing this brief sketch of the Life of Tennyson, and this
attempt to appreciate his work, I have rested almost entirely on the
Biography by Lord Tennyson (with his kind permission) and on the text
of the Poems.  As to the Life, doubtless current anecdotes, not given
in the Biography, are known to me, and to most people.  But as they
must also be familiar to the author of the Biography, I have not
thought it desirable to include what he rejected.  The works of the
"localisers" I have not read:  Tennyson disliked these researches, as
a rule, and they appear to be unessential, and often hazardous.  The
professed commentators I have not consulted.  It appeared better to
give one's own impressions of the Poems, unaffected by the
impressions of others, except in one or two cases where matters of
fact rather than of taste seemed to be in question.  Thus on two or
three points I have ventured to differ from a distinguished living
critic, and have given the reasons for my dissent.  Professor
Bradley's Commentary on In Memoriam {1} came out after this sketch
was in print.  Many of the comments cited by Mr Bradley from his
predecessors appear to justify my neglect of these curious inquirers.
The "difficulties" which they raise are not likely, as a rule, to
present themselves to persons who read poetry "for human pleasure."
