Washington, Dec. 24th, 1848.

My dear father:--

Your letter of the 7th was received night before last. I very
cheerfully send you the twenty dollars, which sum you say is
necessary to save your land from sale. It is singular that you
should have forgotten a judgment against you; and it is more
singular that the plaintiff should have let you forget it so long,
particularly as I suppose you have always had property enough to
satisfy a judgment of that amount. Before you pay it, it would be
well to be sure you have not paid it; or, at least, that you can
not prove you have paid it. Give my love to Mother, and all the
connections.

Affectionately your son,

A. LINCOLN.
