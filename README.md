# Measuring Text Documents Similarities
We were given a set of documents and we need to retrieve relevant documents that are similar based on their ft.idf feature vectors. A vector space model is an algebraic model, involving two steps, in first step we represent the text documents into vector of words and in second step we transform to numerical format so that we can apply any text mining techniques. In document vectors representation step, it includes breaking each document into words, applying preprocessing steps such as removing stopwords, punctuations, special characters etc. After preprocessing the documents we represent them as vectors of words. We should note that a word which occurs in most of the documents might not contribute to represent the document relevance whereas less frequently occurred terms might define document relevance. This can be achieved using a method known as term frequency - inverse document frequency (tf-idf), which gives higher weights to the terms which occurs more in a document but rarely occurs in all other documents,lower weights to the terms which commonly occurs within and across all the documents.
